# Coronopedia

This Python project, initially created in the 12th grade, delves into the COVID-19 pandemic by providing a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for exploring relevant data.

<strong>Key Features:</strong>

<strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Leverages libraries like pandas and potentially Matplotlib (if not already included) to present data in clear and informative charts or graphs.<br>
<strong>Interactive Exploration:</strong> Employs tkinter to create a responsive GUI, allowing users to navigate and interact with the data seamlessly.
<strong>Educational Value:</strong> Serves as a valuable resource for understanding the complexities of the pandemic, potentially incorporating elements like timelines or explanations.

<strong>Getting Started:</strong>

<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ensure you have Python (version 3 recommended) and the necessary libraries (tkinter, pandas, turtle, and potentially Matplotlib) installed.<br>
<strong>Running the Script:</strong> To run Coronopedia, download the CORONOPEDIA zip file, extract its contents, and double-click the coronopedia.py file within the extracted folder.
